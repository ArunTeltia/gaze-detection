# Eye gaze with Tensorflow.js

- [x] Calculate difference moving eyes right/left
- [x] Calculate Looking up / down
- [x] Adapt to z position of face
- [x] Calculate looking straight forward (going back to initial position) // normalized eye movement
- [x] normalize up/down
- [x] Adapt to rotation of face
- [x] Try to select words/phrases/letters with eye movement
- [x] Hide video
- [x] Make sure event is counter as once
- [x] Build demo with writing words

- [ ] Refactor
- [ ] build demo writing code with eyes

- [ ] Does normalizing based on bounding box work for different shapes of faces?
